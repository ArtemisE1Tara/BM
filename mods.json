This supports overriding whether or not you want debris, the HUD type, and environmental effects (lighting) based on many factors of the map, such as its playlist, NPS, NJS and note offset.\r\n\r\n- SlowResume: Slows down (or speeds up) your resume time for comfort.\r\n\r\n- Pause button customisation: Allows you to specify multiple buttons to be required to pause, thus decreasing accidental pauses. You can even move your buttons over to your other controller (which actually works properly now). A preview is available for you to test it out.\r\n\r\n- Pause menu button confirmation: Allows you to add a confirmation prompt to whichever buttons in the pause menu you want.
