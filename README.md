# BMBF Manager
The utility to install songs, install mods, install/update BMBF, install HitSounds, download automatically made playlists, get better support, switch between the modded and unmodded Beat Saber Version, do full backups, edit playlists, transfer your song library, install Qosmetics and way more
# How-to
**Note: BMBF Manager only works natively on Windows.**
## **Go to [releases](https://github.com/ComputerElite/BM/releases) and download the latest zip file (named BM.zip) first. Then right click the downloaded zip and click "extract all". Then open the exe with the `BM` as icon**
## **For BMBF Manager to work properly you have to enable developer mode on your Quest. You can find a written guide [here](https://github.com/ComputerElite/wiki/wiki/Enable-Developer-Mode-for-OQ)**
## The First Time you launch the program it asks you for administrative access. If you want the best support click yes. otherwise no. (can be changed any time in the settings)

# All Instructions are [here](https://github.com/ComputerElite/wiki/wiki/BM)

## Info
Currently BMBF 2 is in the working. As I can see from the test releases (those are only for testing and can make you factory reset your Quest so **Don't use them**) much changed. Since nothing is finalised yet I can't really start but I'll do my best to make BMBF Manager compatible with BMBF 2 as soon as possible (please note that BMBF manager might only work with Beat Saber first. Now you ask why? Well BMBF 2 will be able to mod any game which is made with ill2cpp in unity)

# Known Issues
- Non fixable issues:
   - Advanced Backups, version switching back to modded and Automatic BMBF Modding will most likely not work on Quest 2 since adb is more locked down.

# To-Do
